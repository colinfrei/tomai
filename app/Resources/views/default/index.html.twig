            <p>Tomai let's you easily give others access to your email. Because transparency is a good thing.</p>

                Tomai copies email messages that are labelled with a label from Gmail to a Google Group. Choose one or more of your existing labels, so you don't need to change your workflow. By default a Google Group will give everyone in your Google Apps organisation read-access to those emails, but you can adjust the permissions of the group to be more specific.

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <h4>Who will see my email?</h4>
            <p>Read access is handled by the Google Group, but that allows much more flexibility than Gmail. By default, anyone in the Google Apps organisation can read the emails. You can adjust this in the Google Group settings if you like though (click on 'Manage -> Permissions -> Basic permissions').</p>

            <h4>There are a lot of weird characters in my email.</h4>
            <p>Email as a protocol is really messy, and the Google Groups Migration API Tomai uses isn't great either. That means, that sometimes (surprisingly often), I need to convert the content of the email into a different encoding. I'm sure there are quite some places where I haven't done this yet, or it's not working correctly. Hopefully that will get better in time.</p>

            <h4>Can you add X?</h4>
            <p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/colinfrei/tomai">on Github</a>, please add an issue there.</p>

            <h4>What does the name mean?</h4>
            <p>We seem to have a theme in Liip's Team Lego of picking japanese words for tools. According to <a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/ja/transparency">Google Translate</a>, T≈çmei is japanese for transparency.</p>
